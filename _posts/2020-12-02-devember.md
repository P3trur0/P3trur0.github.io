This is my **Devember 2020 devlog**. Probably I will stop somewhere during this month because of other mandatory duties, although I actually hope this won't happen :smile:

The general aim of this year edition is to improve my functional Scala skillset implementing a playground project using **ZIO**.

##### 1st December 2020
- setup of the repository
- adding ZIOTest
- creating a dummy main class doing basic I/O.

##### 2nd December 2020

- scaffolding of a configuration management using ZIO, still incomplete.

Taking inspiration from [ZIO Exercises](https://github.com/wi101/zio-examples) by Wiem Zine.

Joining Functional Scala 2020. 
It is an online conference about Scala ecosystem. During the first day we started with a workshop by John De Goes, that spent his day explaining all the major features introduced in Scala 3 such as: `enumerations`, `extension methods`, etc.

##### 3rd December 2020

Few other lines added to the project. Basically they were added to introduce a working ZIO-Config instance to load `application.conf` file through ZIO environments.  
Some steps ahead in my understanding of the ZIO ecosystem, especially I got a better understanding of how the enviroment concepts fits in the the `ZIO` datatype. However, I have still to work in a complete understanding of it.  

Also, I attended the second day of FunctionalScala. New macro features of Scala 3 look really impressive.

##### Devember 2020 statement

_I will participate to the next Devember. My Devember will be programming a playground application to learn ZIO. I promise I will program for my Devember for at least an hour, every day of the next December. I will also write a daily public devlog and will make the produced code publicly available on the internet. No matter what, I will keep my promise._
